# The following repo is supplied by ICANN, and will presumably
#   be updated by ICANN over time. It contains two directories,
#   one for errata put in place in the RFCs, the other for
#   explanations of how RFCs update other RFCs
# It is meant only as starting point for the RFC annotations
#   tool project, not as the complete list of annotations one
#   would ever want.
